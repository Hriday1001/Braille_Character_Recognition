# Braille_Sentnece_Recognition
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can recognize and interpret Braille sentences using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Braille is a writing system used by individuals with visual impairments, where characters are represented as raised dots arranged in a grid of six dots. By leveraging the power of deep learning and CNNs, this project aims to create an accurate and efficient solution for automatic Braille sentence recognition by breaking down the sentence into individual characters using the power of OpenCV , each character is recognised individually and then put together to form the sentence.
